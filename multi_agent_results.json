      "explanation": "The 'Loyalty App' treatment is selected because it offers a non-intrusive method of updating the customer with valuable offers and features without violating any of the customer's communication permissions.

This treatment is compliant with the customer's permissions as it does not involve email communication, respects the preferred contact method (SMS and Calls allowed), and does not violate the do not disturb hours (19:00-08:00).

      "explanation": "The 'Retention SMS' is selected since it is an enabled option allowing direct communication via SMS, compliant with the customer's permissions to receive SMS marketing. This option is available within the allowed contact times and respects 'Do Not Disturb' hours. The customer has shown interest in reducing their international calling costs; therefore, this medium can effectively convey tailored offers such as the 'Asia Connect Bundle' with optimized rates, directly targeting their stated needs and increasing Life Time Value. Using SMS ensures timely delivery with a priority ranking suitable for addressing the customer's concerns about competitive rates effectively.",
